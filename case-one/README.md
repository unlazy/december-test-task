### Original task
You're given an array of numbers. The array contains exactly two elements appearing only once. 
All the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. 
Their order is not important.

The algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

#### Example:
Input: `[100,200,100,300,200,500]`

Output: `[300,500]` (`[500, 300]` is also correct)
